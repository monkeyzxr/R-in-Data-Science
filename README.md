# R-in-Data-Science
This project is to solve statistical learning problems by using R language. These problems include linear regression, classification, resampling, model selection, nonlinear methods, tree-based methods, support vector machine, unsupervised learning.

This project helps to learn the basics of statistical learning and gain experience applying various modeling techniques to data sets using the R language.


Project 1:

The first project will be to apply the Association Rules Mining technique to look for association rules in the following dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/STUDENT+ALCOHOL+CONSUMPTION. This page contains information about the dataset and the links to the data itself. Note that some of the variables in the dataset are numeric, so you will want to clean the dataset and create factors for all of the variables. Look for good support, god confidence, and high lift.


Project 2:
The second project will be to apply the K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering techniques to look for clusters in the following dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds. This page contains information about the dataset and the links to the data itself. Use both methods and look for a good clustering structure.
